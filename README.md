### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- âš¡ Fun fact: THERE ARE 2 GROUPS OF SLOTH IN THE WORLD
Different sloth groups can be easily identified by the number of long, curved claws on their forelimbs. The two-toed sloths, as the name suggests, have two claws on their front limbs, while the three-toed sloths have three claws on all four limbs. The two-toed sloths are also slightly larger than their three-toed counterparts, and both fall under different taxonomic Family. Altogether, there are six sloth species that are found in the Americas, mainly in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.
Hoffmanâ€™s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni)
Linnaeusâ€™s two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)
Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus)
Maned three-toed sloth (Bradypus torquatus)
Brown throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus)
Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus)
At present, 4 sloth species are listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The maned three-toed sloth is vulnerable, while the pygmy three-toed sloth is critically endangered and the sloth species at greatest risk of extinction.
